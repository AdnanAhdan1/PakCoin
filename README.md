PakCoin is an experimental digital currency that can be instantly paid to anyone in the world. Bitcoin uses point-to-point technology, without the operation of a central authority: managing transactions and disbursing funds collectively by the network. PakCoin Core is the name of the open source software that you can use in this currency.
